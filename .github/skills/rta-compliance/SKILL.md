# RTA Compliance Skill

Use this when crafting tenant communications under the Ontario Residential Tenancies Act (RTA).

- Keep tone procedural, calm, and factual; avoid emotion.
- Cite relevant RTA sections for notice/repair/entry timelines when possible.
- Confirm receipt of the tenant’s report, summarize the issue, and state next steps with timelines.
- Offer lawful remedies and outline landlord obligations (e.g., essential services, reasonable time to repair).
- Avoid admissions of fault; focus on process and compliance.
- Escalation: if behavior interferes with reasonable enjoyment, reference N5 notice workflow (see templates/n5-notice.md).

## Notices
- N4: Non-payment of rent (payment plan proposals are allowed; keep procedural tone).
- N5: Interference/undue damage/disturbance (two-strike rule; include dates and remedy window).
- N11: Mutual agreement to end tenancy (landlord cannot force; only offer when appropriate).
- N12/N13: Landlord’s own use/repairs/demolition (use only when legally justified; ensure compensation/notice periods).

## Prompting guidance (for testing)
- Always include the tenant message and triage summary in the prompt.
- Ask for a structured, short draft with timelines and RTA references.
- Keep responses approval-ready (do not auto-send). Use bullet-like, concise paragraphs.
