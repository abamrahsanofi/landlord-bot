# Contractor Dispatch Skill

- Identify required trade (plumber, electrician, HVAC, general handyman).
- Check preferred vendor list and availability windows before proposing dispatch.
- Avoid confirming appointments automatically; draft proposed slots for landlord approval.
- Include issue summary, urgency, and access constraints in the vendor brief.
